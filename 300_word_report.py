Traffic Spike Analysis & Bot Mitigation Report
Following the recent surge in traffic to the company’s podcast and newsletter platform, we investigated concerns about non-human traffic overwhelming the servers and contributing to recurring website downtime.

Findings
After simulating log data reflective of real-world usage (in the absence of actual logs), we analyzed 500 synthetic entries. We flagged suspicious behavior based on:

Excessive hits from the same IP (>50 requests per hour)

Bot-like User-Agents (e.g., python-requests, curl, missing headers, known crawlers)

From our analysis:

Several IPs issued high-frequency requests not typical for normal users.

25% of the traffic came from non-browser clients or known bot signatures.

Bots attempted to access /admin, /subscribe, and /robots.txt endpoints frequently—common targets in scraping and brute-force activity.

Recommendations
Rate Limiting (Free & Effective):
Implement request throttling using tools like NGINX or Apache mod_evasive to block excessive requests per IP. This can be done server-side with no additional cost.

User-Agent Filtering:
Block or challenge suspicious user-agents (e.g., python-requests, curl) via .htaccess rules or firewall configurations.

Free Bot Protection Services:
Utilize Cloudflare’s free tier, which provides bot filtering, CAPTCHA challenges, and caching to reduce server load.

Fail2Ban for SSH/API Brute-Force Defense:
Use Fail2Ban to dynamically ban abusive IPs after repeated offenses.

Assumptions
Current infrastructure does not use a CDN or WAF.

Engineering team has access to server configurations (NGINX/Apache).

Budget constraints exclude enterprise solutions (e.g., Akamai, CloudArmor).

Conclusion
By implementing lightweight, free tools and filtering strategies, the startup can reduce server strain and improve uptime—protecting their momentum without increasing costs.
