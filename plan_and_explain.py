"""
Tech Stack Proposal (Minimum Requirements)
For cost-effective log analysis and bot filtering:

Python 3.10+
"""

"""
Pandas for parsing and analyzing logs

You used pandas to:

Load structured log data into a DataFrame

Filter IPs, sort suspicious entries, count requests

Flag bot-like behavior based on user-agent and hit frequency

Included pandas in requirements.txt, so your script depends on it and it is already justified.

Flask (if simple visualization/API needed)

What We'll Build with Flask?

Feature	        Description

/               Home page (basic intro or upload form)
/upload         POST route to upload a log file
/report         Show flagged IPs or stats from latest analysis
/api/report/	JSON response with flagged IPs for API use


Routes:

Route	        Description
/	            Upload form for log file
/upload	        Accepts file → analyzes it → stores result
/report	        Displays suspicious IPs in HTML format
/api/report	    Returns the IPs in JSON format

Docker for containerizing the solution (stretch goal)

"""
Tooling and Detection Ideas

We'll check for:

Repeated requests from the same IP in short timeframes

Suspicious user-agents (e.g., missing or bot-like ones)

Non-browser traffic (e.g., CURL, Python-requests, etc.)

Excessive hits to pages that real users rarely visit

Bot Mitigation Recommendations

Rate limiting via a reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX with limit_req module)

Use of Cloudflare free tier for bot protection (low cost)

Blocking or CAPTCHA-challenging certain traffic patterns
"""


"""
Deliverables

Python script to process logs and detect suspicious traffic

Dockerfile (optional) to containerize the tool

300-word report with:

Problem summary

Key log findings

Cost-conscious mitigation strategy

Assumptions and next steps

"""

"""
Step-by-Step Plan Without Logs
Make Reasonable Assumptions
You will need to create synthetic sample logs that mimic what you'd expect from a
podcast/newsletter site under attack.

We can assume logs like this:

swift
Copy
Edit
127.0.0.1 - - [16/Jul/2025:12:34:56 +0000] "GET /podcast/ep45 HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
212.145.67.89 - - [16/Jul/2025:12:34:57 +0000] "GET /subscribe HTTP/1.1" 200 123 "-" "python-requests/2.28.1"
From these, we detect patterns like:

Too many hits from same IP

Suspicious user agents

Accessing weird endpoints in bursts

2. Write the Analysis Code
We will create a script that:

Parses synthetic logs

Flags suspicious patterns (rate limits, bot UAs, etc.)

Outputs flagged IPs for potential blocking

3. 300-Word Report
You will write a report with:

The assumptions made

Observed patterns in your dummy logs

Proposed mitigation (e.g., NGINX rate limiting, user-agent filtering)

Cost analysis (free tools like Fail2Ban, Cloudflare, etc.)

4. Bonus: Containerize (Stretch Goal)
Use Docker to wrap it neatly. I can generate the Dockerfile too.
